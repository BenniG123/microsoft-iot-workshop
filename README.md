# Microsoft IoT Workshop
Welcome!  This repository contains source files and resources for the Iowa State Fall 2016 Microsoft IoT Lab Jam.  Here you will learn how to setup and deploy connected applications to an Windows powered IoT device.

## Requirements
Windows 10 desktop computer

**Optional but encouraged:** Your own [IoT Core Supported Device](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/explore/deviceoptions)

## Setup
### Install Visual Studio 2015 Community or Higher
Follow [this link](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) to download and install Visual Studio.  Make sure you install the UWP tools.

### Install Windows 10 IoT Core Dashboard
Follow [this link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/downloads) to download and install the IoT Core Dashboard.  You will need this to configure and manage your devices.

### Set your Wind
Follow [this link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/downloads) to download and install the IoT Core Dashboard.  You will need this to configure and manage your devices.

### Are you bringing your own device?
If you are bringing your own [IoT Core Supported Device](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/explore/deviceoptions), follow [this setup guide](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/GetStarted).

#### Net Reg your Device
If you are bringing your own hardware, and it is not previously net-regged, you have 2 options.  First is the quickest, but requires that your device can be connected to internet outside of Iowa State.  Download the [IoT Core Browser Sample](https://developer.microsoft.com/enus/windows/iot/samples/iotbrowser) and deploy it to your device as per the instructions.  Leave this as the default app on your device.  Once your device is connected to Iowa State's network, a web browser should automatically pop up with the net reg screen.  Follow the prompts as necessary.

Second option is to email the [solutions center](http://www.it.iastate.edu/solution/) with your net id and you device's Mac Address, explaining why your device needs to be connected to the network.
